# cargo-audit configuration
#
# GitHub/Dependabot reports GHSA-gg76-hg3v-5q6c / RUSTSEC-2025-0035 against
# `macroquad`.
#
# RustSec marks this as INFORMATIONAL ("unsound") and lists no patched versions.
# We keep `macroquad` confined to the demo-only `braine_viz` crate; the core `braine`
# library remains std-only.
#
# If you need a security-hardened build, avoid building/running `braine_viz` or
# switch the visualizer to a different rendering/UI backend.
